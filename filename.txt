Rhythmic gymnast Linoy Ashram, one of Israel's leading medal prospects at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,
stunned the world and won a gold medal on Saturday after topping a stiff competition in the individual
all-around final.

The 22-year-old became the first-ever Israeli woman to bag gold at the Summer Olympics and the second
Israeli to win the top prize in Tokyo after gymnast Artem Dolgopyat did the same on Sunday in the men's
artistic gymnastics competition. They join windsurfer Gal Friedman who won Israel's first-ever gold medal
in Athens 2004.

This joins the bronze medals won by the judo mixed team and taekwondo fighter Avishag Semberg in the womenâ€™s
49kg category, marking the most successful Olympic campaign in the history of Israeli sport
Asharam came to the competition as a clear podium favorite but had to overcome twins Dina and Arina Averina
who have dominated the sport in recent years. Dina won silver in the event and Arina was denied a podium walk,
finishing fourth.
